# sales_prediction_insight_learners
This repository contains the programs and the datasets used in the project.

The main programs:
  1. sales_predictor.py : Will use a training dataset (by default, SP_Train.xlsx) to fit a model and then use it to predict a test dataset.

      To run the perdiction task: <span style='font-family: Consolas'>python sales_predictor.py --test_file <test_dataset_file_addtess> \[--train_file <train_dataset_file_location>\] <\span>
     
  3. config.py : Here one can configure the Default training dataset file location or the output file location. Also one can select a model for the prediction.
  4. preprocessing.py : It contains necessary methods for performing the data preprocessing.

Datasets:
  1. SP_Train.xlsx : The raw dataset which was provided for the project.
  2. SP_Test.xlsx: A Test dataset created by spliting the raw dataset, from which, the target feature column is removed.
  3. Train.csv & Test.csv are the datasets generated by spliting SP_Train.xlsx through train_test_split method

Experiment Notebooks:
  1. data_plot_experiments.ipynb
  2. experiments.ipynb
  3. HyperTuning.ipynb
